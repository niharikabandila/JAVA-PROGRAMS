//1.interface is fully abstract class
//2.in interface all the methods by default those are public abstract
//void m1();
//public void m1();
//public abstract void m1();
//3.in interface we can allow to declare constants only
//4.we are allowed to create a reference variable to an interface but it is not possible to create instance
//5.the class which implements an interface,it must be give the definitions for all the method which are declared inside the interface otherwise that class will be treated as abstract class
//6.interface are used to hide the some of the services of the implemented class.
